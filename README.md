# Design456App
WIP!!!!!!

Turn Design456 Workbench to more powerful software. Combine GLFW and Imgui to one application.
Take benifit of each tool whenever you want to make a different type of window. 
All these tools will be used for making a good direct modeling tool.

# Notes:
This is an expermental pieces of code. Please don't use it in any serious application. 
It is still in very earliy development stage and I need more time to make it useful. 
Only Windows is supported. Glad is not the latest. My laptop dosen't support that. 

# Status:
1-FLTK failed - Switch to ImGui

2-Shader problem is kind of fixed and now I can see the shader. 

2-Some issues with the LOG system. 

3-Code might change alot. So be patient

4-ImGui is still in the begining of the development. I have to do the GUI part asap.

5-Since I am submoduling some libraries, lua files are not included with these submodules. At the moment I don't know how to get that fixed. You find the files under the folder Resources for each module.

6-Always devbranch is the active development brnach .. But from time to time I merge what I think are good to have in main. Alot of work remained yet :(

Don't forget that you need to download preemake5.exe 

# Some Ideas are comming from:
Some of the code is inspired by TheCherno and Hazel Game Engine.
