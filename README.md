# Design456App
WIP!!!!!!

Turn Design456 Workbench to more powerful software. Combine GLFW, Imgui ImGuimzo in to one application.

# Notes:
This is an expermental pieces of code. Please don't use it in any serious application. 
It is still in very earliy development phase and I need more time to make it useful. 
Only Windows is supported at the moment. Glad is 4.3. My laptop dosen't support the latest version. 

# Status:
1-ImGui is used for creating the GUI interface

2-ImGuimzo still not working  

2-Some issues with the LOG system. (low priority) 

3-Code might change alot. So be patient

4-XY-Plane is somehow working now. Needs more turning. The problem is with the camera, light ..etc 

5-Since I am submoduling some libraries, lua files are not included with these submodules. At the moment I don't know how to get that fixed. You find the files under the folder Resources for each module.

6-Always devbranch is the active development brnach .. But from time to time I merge what I think are good to have them in main. 

7-After making a stable cameras (6 cameras), I will release this version as a base code for any other project you might need such a setup. But for now the development is continuing. 

Don't forget that you need to download preemake5.exe 

# Some Ideas are comming from:
Some of the code is inspired by TheCherno (thaks) and Hazel Game Engine.
