# Design456App
WIP!!!!!!

Turn Design456 Workbench to more powerful software. Combine FLTK, GLFW, and maybe Imgui to one application.
Take benifit of each tool whenever you want to make a different type of window. 
All these tools will be used for making a good direct modeling tool.

# Notes:
This is an expermental pieces of code. Please don't use it in any serious application. 
It is still in very earliy development stage and I need more time to make it useful. 
Only Windows is supported. Glad is not the latest. My laptop dosen't support that. 

# Status:
This is Branch is frozen. The basic idea is to keep this branch as it works somehow to show the original shapes made by the joined code from the other library.
It is useful to keep this for future works. As if the code dosent' work at any stage, you might come back to see here. 
Other thing, is to show how I manged to join glfw and fltk in a one project. As a start project for other developers.

-You need to download FLTK and compile it by yourself. It should be under frtk/vendor/fltk folder. 

-Since I am submoduling some libraries, lua files are not included with these submodules. At the moment I don't know how to get that fixed. You find the files under the folder Resources for each module.

Don't forget that you need to download preemake5.exe
